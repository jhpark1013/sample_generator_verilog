# sample_generator_verilog

Many designs require custom sample generator IPs for generating data from one part of the design and observing the correct sequence of data transfer at another part of the design. The sample generator can act as a multiplexer for two different cases: one for bypassing the sample generator and the other for using the data generated by the custom IP. The port responsible for enabling one case versus the other can be named with a custom label; we will call it AXI_En (short for axi enable). Other ports can be defined; there is freedom in deciding the number and functionality of the ports as long as they have useful functionalities and work in synchrony with other signals guided by the AXI protocol. Ports on the IP acts as portals (or bridges) between the user or other components (i.e. memory or cpu) and the AXI-world. For example, the sample generator could create data of flexible frame sizes, in which case the IP should have a port enabling the user to define the frame size.
